Each plain text character is, actually, ASCII/American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  

For example, 
Capital letter: 'A'...is ASCII code number: 65
Capital letter: 'B'...is ASCII code number: 66
Capital letter: 'C'...is ASCII code number: 67
...and, so on...
Capital letter: 'X'...is ASCII code number: 88
Capital letter: 'Y'...is ASCII code number: 89
Capital letter: 'Z'...is ASCII code number: 90

Thus, the keyboard characters representing each of the 26 capital letters: A-Z...;  
are each represented by ASCII code numbers going from: 65-90.

-----

Some ASCII code characters are printed as being: 'letters/numbers/punctuation symbols'...;
which you can see by looking down and reading off from the top of your keyboard keys.  

Whilst other ASCII code characters are kept 'hidden' and invisible...;     
and, therefore, are NOT actually printed on top of the keyboard keys.  

The number of ASCII code characters begins at: 0...and, goes up to: 255.
