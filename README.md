# txt
In the world of computing...  
plain text files use filename extension: [.txt];  
it consists of plain text characters.../  
or, ASCII/American Standard Code for Information Interchange codes.    
For example: Capital letter 'A'...is ASCII code number: 65/'B' is ASCII code number: 66/and, so on.  

The full ASCII code set of numbers used to represent each individual character goes from : 0 - 255.

-(**NOTE(1)**: Some ASCII code characters you can, actually, see...  
by looking down and reading off the 'letters/numbers/punctuation symbols' being shown on top of your keyboard keys;      
whilst other ASCII code characters are kept 'hidden' and invisible...; these can only be accessed by typing in the ASCII code number, directly.)-

-----

Text files are easily read/and, thus, are 'shareable' over the internet...;   
as most web browsers will be able to display any file containing a [.txt] file name extension. 

So, in theory, at least...instead, of creating [.html] web page files to share with others...;   
you could create plain text [.txt] files to share, instead.  

The limitations being that unlike HTML web page files: [.html]...plain text [.txt] files...         
- doesn't allow for 'clickable' links  
- interaction with CSS: colouring/resizing/effects: bold/italic/underline/bulleted list items/and, so on...       
- etc.

-----

Text [.txt] files can also be read by most programming languages;     
as a matter of fact, programming language files...are themselves written/saved as being just plain text ASCII codes;        
only, instead of using the regular filename extension: [.txt];      
they use a different file name extension to indicate which programming language created that file:  
- [.c], C programming language code file   
- [.cpp], C++ programming language code file  
- [.py], Python programming language code file  
- [.java], Java programming language code file   
- etc.

# Exercises

As an exercise...

- Take a plain text [.txt] file...; and, change it's filename extension to become: [.html]. Now, go and view the page over the internet. The plain text characters will still show...(which, of course, includes no HTML formatting).
 
- Take an HTML [.html] file...and, change it's filename extension to become: [.txt], instead. When one views this page, now, over the internet...all HTML code formatting will have completely vanished...?!  

- Encode either a word/or, sentence...eg. change alphabet letter: 'a', to become the next letter up: 'b'/letter: 'b' to become the next letter up: 'c'/if the end of the alphabet is reached; then, change letter: 'z' to become unused letter: 'a'. So, 'abc' now becomes: 'bcd'/-etc. Save the file as being called: [encoded-text.txt]. Go and upload it onto the internet...for other people to guess what the code says/means...???

## Instructions for users of Windows OS/Operating System platform...
 
- Open up Notepad word processor...  
  next, inside of the Notepad window, whilst holding down the [Alt] key...; type in the number: 65...a capital letter should appear: A.  
  ...this means that the ASCII code number which is used to represent the capital letter: 'A'...is the number: 65.
  
 **NOTE(2)**: Type in the number: 65...not by using the normal keyboard part/but, the 'numbers' keyboard part to the side of the key board.

- Open up Notepad word processor...  
  and, inside of the Notepad window...type the word:  
  > .LOG  
  ...next, repeatedly, close/open this same file...; and, you should discover that each time the file is saved...;  
  Notepad will, automatically, log this event...by including a *new* time/date stamp.
