# txt
[.txt] extension files do contain plain text characters/or, ASCII codes.

Text files are easily 'shareable' over the internet...;   
as most web browsers will be able to display any file containing a [.txt] file name extension. 

So, in theory, at least...instead, of creating [.html] web page files to share...;  
you could create plain text [.txt] files to share, instead.  

The limitation being...unlike HTML web page files...[.txt] files...       
- doesn't allow for 'clickable' links  
- interaction with CSS: colouring/resizing   
- etc.

[.txt] files can also be read by most programming languages;   
as a matter of fact, programming language files...are themselves written/saved as being just plain text;    
only with a different file name extension: c/cpp/py/-etc.
