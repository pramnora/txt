# txt
Plain text files use filename extension: [.txt];  
they consist of plain text characters.../or, ASCII/American Standard Code for Information Interchange codes.    
For example: Capital letter 'A'...is ASCII code number: 65/'B' is ASCII code number: 66/and, so on.  

Text files are easily read/and, thus, are 'shareable' over the internet...;   
as most web browsers will be able to display any file containing a [.txt] file name extension. 

So, in theory, at least...instead, of creating [.html] web page files to share with others...;   
you could create plain text [.txt] files to share, instead.  

The limitations being that unlike HTML web page files: [.html]...plain text [.txt] files...         
- doesn't allow for 'clickable' links  
- interaction with CSS: colouring/resizing/effects: bold/italic/underline/bulleted list items/and, so on...       
- etc.

Text [.txt] files can also be read by most programming languages;     
as a matter of fact, programming language files...are themselves written/saved as being just plain text;      
only, instead of using the regular filename extension: [.txt];      
they use a different file name extension: c/cpp/py/java/-etc.
